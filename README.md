# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the fares between rural, suburban, and urban cities. This is done in two ways: finding out each city type's average fare per ride and per driver, and finding out each city type's total fares over the first four months of 2019.
    
## Results
### Averages
![PyBer_dataframe_summary.png](/analysis/PyBer_dataframe_summary.png)
Above is a dataframe summarizing the average fare per ride and per driver for each city type. From this, it can be seen that the lower the amount of rides and drivers, the higher the fair on average. This results in the average PyBer ride in a rural city being about ten dollars more expensive than in an urban city. Additionally, for both rural and suburban cities, there are more drivers than rides, which results in the average fare per ride being lower than the average fare per driver. In urban cities, however, the high amount of drivers compared to rides results in a driver paying more for a PyBer ride than getting paid for driving on PyBer.


### Totals

The above line graph showcases the total fare for rural, suburban, and urban cities from January 2019 to April 2019. As expected from the summary dataframe, rural cities do not rake in as much fare money as suburban cities, and suburban cities follow that same trend with urban cities. Each of the cities falls into various ranges; Rural: < $500, Suburban: $500 - $1500, Urban: > $1500.

## Summary
My first suggestion based on these results is to consider the infrastructure of rural cities; is there anything actively preventing PyBer's success there, or is PyBer simply not well known enough to be a viable option? Are these rural cities which simply do not have good roads? Or is everything necessary for life within walking distance (or within public transportation distance). If driving is simply not that big of a thing within these rural cities, it's probably best for profit to either crank the fares up or pull out of such cities. If there is no demand, there is clearly no need for supply. Secondly, if driving is viable and common within rural cities, there is a steep challenge to it's popularity there - digging deep into the rider's wallet. As long as fares are so high in rural cities, rides will be low and vice versa. Perhaps in rural (and even suburban and urban) cities there could be some sort of program offering money off in exchange for recommending a friend to ride with PyBer. This could lead to us getting more riders and eventually being able to bring the fare down to a low enough level that people actively want to continue riding with PyBer. Lastly, considering that there are more drivers than rides in urban cities, maybe the amount of drivers should be limited, or there should be some sort of process of closing the driver relationship with those who are unable/unwilling to continue driving. However, this data spans only 5 months; what would be the longest allowed period of driver inactivity? Additionally, since there were some drivers within urban cities who cannot have given anybody a ride due to there being 750 more drivers than rides, PyBer's popularity for rides and not for drives needs a boost in urban cities.
